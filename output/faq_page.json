            "question": "Is GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum suitable for sensitive skin?",
            "answer": "GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum is generally well-tolerated. However, individuals with very sensitive skin may experience a mild tingling sensation upon initial application. This is usually temporary and indicates the active ingredients are working. If irritation persists, we recommend discontinuing use and consulting a dermatologist."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are there any other potential side effects besides mild tingling?",
            "answer": "Beyond mild tingling for sensitive skin, significant side effects are rare. Always perform a patch test on a small area of skin before full facial application. If you experience redness, itching, burning, or any severe discomfort, rinse immediately and consult a healthcare professional."

            "question": "Can I use GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?",

        {
            "question": "Does this serum increase sun sensitivity?",
            "answer": "Vitamin C itself does not typically increase sun sensitivity. In fact, it acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect your skin from environmental damage. However, it is absolutely crucial to always follow up with a broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) every morning, as Vitamin C works best in conjunction with sun protection to prevent new dark spots and maintain skin health."

            "question": "Can I use this serum at night instead of in the morning?",

For Retinol, we generally recommend using Vitamin C in the morning and Retinol at night to avoid potential irritation and ensure optimal efficacy of both powerful ingredients."
        },
        {
            "question": "How many drops are recommended for each application?",
            "answer": "We recommend 2-3 drops for your entire face. A small amount is potent and effective, so a little goes a long way!"

        {
            "question": "What happens if I forget to apply sunscreen after using the serum?",
            "answer": "While Vitamin C offers antioxidant protection, it is not a substitute for sunscreen. Forgetting sunscreen can expose your skin to harmful UV rays, potentially undoing the benefits of the serum and increasing the risk of sun damage, premature aging, and new dark spots. Always apply a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I use GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum around my eyes?",
            "answer": "Yes, you can carefully apply it around the orbital bone, avoiding direct contact with the eyes. If you have very sensitive skin around the eyes, or are prone to irritation, you might prefer a dedicated eye cream."
        },

        },
        {
            "question": "Will GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum help with acne or acne scars?",
            "answer": "While not specifically an acne treatment, Vitamin C can be highly effective in fading post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which are the dark spots left behind after acne breakouts. Its antioxidant properties also support overall skin health, which may indirectly benefit acne-prone skin. For active acne, we recommend consulting a dermatologist."
        },
        {
            "question": "Will this serum make my oily/combination skin feel greasier?",

        },
        {

            "answer": "It is highly effective for common types of hyperpigmentation such as sun spots, age spots, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) from acne. For more stubborn or deeper pigmentation like melasma, results may vary, and a combination approach with other targeted treatments might be needed."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is this product non-comedogenic?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Will the results be permanent?",
            "answer": "The positive results you achieve with GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum are maintained with continued use. If you stop using the serum, your skin will gradually revert to its previous state, especially with ongoing sun exposure and environmental factors. Consistency is key for lasting benefits and maintaining a radiant complexion."
